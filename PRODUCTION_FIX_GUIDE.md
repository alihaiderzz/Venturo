# Production Fix Guide for Venturo

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The production site (joinventuro.com) is failing with `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` because:

1. **Test Clerk Keys in Production**: The site is using test keys (`pk_test_` and `sk_test_`) in production
2. **Domain Mismatch**: Test keys don't work with production domains

## ‚úÖ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Middleware Error Handling**
- Added try-catch blocks to handle Clerk failures gracefully
- Added environment variable validation
- Public routes now work even if Clerk fails
- Protected routes redirect to home page if Clerk fails

### 2. **Layout Fallback**
- Added Clerk configuration check in layout
- Site will render without authentication if Clerk is not configured
- Prevents complete site failure

## üîß **IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION FIX**

### **Step 1: Update Environment Variables in Vercel**

Go to your Vercel dashboard and update these environment variables:

```bash
# REPLACE TEST KEYS WITH PRODUCTION KEYS
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_production_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_production_key
```

### **Step 2: Get Production Clerk Keys**

1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) dashboard
2. Select your Venturo application
3. Go to "API Keys" section
4. Copy the **Production** keys (not test keys)
5. Update in Vercel environment variables

### **Step 3: Configure Clerk for Production Domain**

1. In Clerk dashboard, go to "Domains"
2. Add `joinventuro.com` as an allowed domain
3. Remove any test domains if needed

### **Step 4: Redeploy**

After updating environment variables:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## üß™ **TESTING THE FIX**

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Test the middleware fix locally
npm run dev
curl -I http://localhost:3000/
```

### **Production Testing**
1. Visit https://joinventuro.com
2. Should load without 500 error
3. Authentication should work properly

## üìã **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Production Clerk keys are set in Vercel
- [ ] `joinventuro.com` is added to Clerk allowed domains
- [ ] Site loads without 500 error
- [ ] Sign up/Sign in works
- [ ] Protected routes work
- [ ] Public routes work without authentication

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

```bash
# Commit the middleware fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix middleware error handling for production"
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy, or manually redeploy in dashboard
```

## üîç **MONITORING**

After deployment, monitor:
1. Vercel function logs for any remaining errors
2. Clerk dashboard for authentication metrics
3. Site performance and user experience

## üìû **SUPPORT**

If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify Clerk configuration
3. Test with production keys locally first
